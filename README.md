#Hazardous Asteroid Detection

Objective: Identify hazardous asteroids using machine learning to enhance planetary safety.
Models Used:
Logistic Regression: Analyzes how different factors indicate asteroid hazards.
Random Forests: Utilizes multiple decision trees for diverse insights.
Decision Tree: Makes hazard determinations through yes-or-no questions.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): Classifies asteroids by drawing clear boundaries.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Relies on nearby asteroids to classify new ones.
Neural Network: Recognizes complex patterns in asteroid data.
Gaussian Naive Bayes: Uses probabilities based on past data to classify asteroids.
Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM): Combines strengths of multiple models for accurate predictions.
Goal: Leverage diverse ML models to detect potentially dangerous asteroids and protect our planet.
